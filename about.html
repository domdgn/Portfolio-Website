            <h1>About <span>me</span></h1>
            <br>
            <p>Hello! I'm Dominic Duggan, currently in my first year at the University of Winchester, where I'm studying Immersive Technologies. <br><br>
                I have a passion for coding and virtual reality tech, which leads me to spend countless hours prototyping games in <span>Unity</span>, and many more in VR. <br><br> On top of that, I love 3D modeling with <span>Blender</span> and <span>Fusion 360</span>, and I'm always pushing myself to improve my skillset in these programs.<br><br>
                I have been using <span>Blender</span> for over 5 years, but my skills have been growing exponentially as my studies progress.
                <br><br>
                My favourite projects to work on are a mix of fun, challenge, and a bit of experimentation - both for myself and the player - as I find it so rewarding to spend time learning new methodology and logic in my programming, and having it work out <em>after spending hours fixing bugs.</em> <br><br>In both my free-time as an indie developer, and my future career, I aim to create <span>engaging and interesting games and art</span> in the digital 3D world. <br><br>
                I'm always on the lookout for exciting new technologies and projects to challenge myself and collaborate with like-minded individuals on!</p>
