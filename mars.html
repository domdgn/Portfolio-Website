                <h2>1.1 | Introduction & Goal</h2>
                <p>This is my second individual art project for IMTC4003. The brief for the project was very broad, allowing for effectively any form of individual work that displays my skills.
                <br><br>I began by creating new Blender and Unity projects, installing the <span>Universal Render Pipeline</span> (URP) in Unity. I used <span>Substance Painter</span> for the first time in this project to create the materials and textures shown.
                </p>
            </section>
<br><br>
            <section>
                <h2>1.2 | Concept and Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                During the conception phase, I was fairly confident with my idea for the medium, an <i>interactive 3D world,</i> which is build from the ground up to be used as a video-game environment.
                <br><br>
                I was initially set on creating a VR experience, allowing for interactable and moveable props and environment features. However, given the time-frame and
                the fact that I was developing a <a href="timeheist.html">VR game</a> alongside this project, I ended up deciding on it being a flatscreen 3D scene.
                <br><br>
                For the setting, I was heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1719.Joseph_McMoneagle">Joe McMoneagle</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chrisramsay52/">Chris Ramsay</a> and <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/space/aliens-ufos/bob-lazar.htm">Bob Lazar</a>.
                <br>
                These people are heavily involved in the <i>UFO conspiracy</i>, and I decided on this being an interesting setting to base my project in.
                <br><br>
                I initially wrote down all of my ideas for the location and theme:
                </p>

<pre style="background: #1e293b; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 40px 0; white-space: pre-wrap;">
<p><h2>Scene Ideas</h3>
    <b>surface of mars, large pyramids, humanoid figures</b> 
        + based directly on Joe McMoneagle's RV to Mars. 
        + natural landscape design 
        - not a lot of potential for interactability
    
    <b>interior of government base and hangar</b>
        + based on Bob Lazar's testimony
        + based on Chris Ramsay's SCIF set
        + lots of material variety
        + lots of interactability

    <b>desert crash site, buried craft</b>
        + interactability inside craft
        + based on Jake Barber's tesitmony ( + Roswell? )
        + interesting weather, blowing sand?
        + mix of organic and hard-surface modelling]
        - might not be extremely visually interesting

</pre>

<p>
    Based on this brainstorming, I decided to proceed further with my first two ideas, the surface of Mars, and the interior of the government base.
    <br><br>
    I began by gathering reference material, for setting and for artstyle.

<br>
<p>
    I followed this research by drawing concept sketches of my ideas, to establish a sense of composition and form.
</p>
<br>

    <img src="assets/mars1984/Crater.png" style="border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px;">
</div>
<br>
<p>
    I then created a quick block-out of the interior, which I will continue to refer to as the <i><span>SCIF</span></i> in this write-up.
    <br>
</p>

<p>
    <br>
    After this, despite the fact that I am very happy with the concept art, I decided to scrap the surface of Mars idea, and work solely on the interior, as it allows me to better perfect my skills and product by focusing on one setting at a time.
    <br>Further, I decided to slightly expand the SCIF to include an additional Hangar area, with an alien craft inside.

                <h2>1.3 | Tools and Software</h2>
                
                <h3>Blender</h3>
                <p>I chose to use Blender as my primary 3D modelling and shading workspace, as I have a lot of experience working in the Blender workspace, since the release of Blender v2.8, and I feel comfortable using the modelling tools provided.</p>
                
                <h3>Unity</h3>
                <p>I chose to use Unity 2022.3.47f1. I was familiar with the program before this project, however I expected to run into a lot of challenges and roadblocks along the way, learning how to navigate them and result in an expanded skillset, suitable for game development.</p>
                
                <h3>Substance Painter</h3>
                <p>I used Substance Painter to create almost all of the materials shown in the project. Aside from a brief introductory lesson, this was my first time using the program.</p>

                <h2>1.4 | Modeling Process</h2>  
                <h3>Step 1: Building</h3>
                <p>As my first step, I decided to <i>(in Blender)</i> build the shape of the walls of the two rooms (SCIF and Hangar) using <span>cubes</span> and <span>booleans</span> to create
                    the walls and windows/doors. 
                </p>
                <div class="image-group-new">
                    <img src="assets/mars1984/building_rooms_1.png" style="border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px;">
                    <img src="assets/mars1984/doorbool2.png" style="border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px; height: 347px; width: 300px;">
                </div>
                <p>
                    As I went along, I imported everything into Unity periodically to check for any errors/issues with scale. I used the Unity premade third-person character rig.
                </p>
                <img src="assets/mars1984/inUnity.png" style="width: 600px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
                <p>
                    However, I realised that it would be easier and more performant to have the walls be cubes with inverted normals, so I used this inital building just for scale, and remade the buildings.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Sometimes, I would have broken normals or incorrect rotation of rooms when importing into Unity. To fix these, I used Blender's <i>flip normals</i> tool, and also applied rotation and scale in Blender.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Step 2: Environment Props</h3>
                <p>
                I modelled all of the environment props (i.e. chairs, table, drawers, skirting boards, doorframe, etc) in Blender, all following a grid scale.
                <br><br>
                <h3 class="responsibilities">- Chairs -</h3>
                <img src="assets/mars1984/chairFull.jpg" style="width: 600px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
                <br>
                For the chair, I began with a cube, I then enabled a bevel modifier, and manipulated the mesh until I reached the desired shape.
                <br>
                <img src="assets/mars1984/chairclay.jpg" style="width: 600px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
                <br>
                The chair legs were created using multiple cubes which were stretched and rotated into position.
                </p>
                <div class="image-group-new">

                <br>
                <img src="assets/mars1984/drawers.jpg" style="width: 600px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px;">
                <p><br>Similar to other environment props, the original mesh was created using a combination of extrusion of a primitive (cube) and the use of modifiers.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, I used a bevel modifier for the edges and curved handles, and I used an array modifier to have the handles as separate islands in the mesh.
                    <br><br>
                    However, I also created a <span>lower-poly mesh</span>, without the bevel modifiers applied, and also some more simple handle geometry. I later baked the normals from the high-poly mesh to the
                    lower-fidelity version. This was to ensure <span>good performance</span> on any hardware where this prop may be used. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The coffee cup was modeled from a <span>cylinder primitive</span> as a base, mostly using the <span>extrude tool</span> to form the shape and features of the cup.
                    I used references which I imported into Blender using the <span>Images as Planes</span> addon.

                <p>
                    I sculpted the alien head prop (who I named Bob) using the Blender sculpt tools. I started with a subdivided cube and used tool such as <span>clay strips</span> to develop the anatomy. I did not use a reference as I did not want it to feel too human.
                    <br><br>
                    Just as the filing cabinet, I created a low-poly version using the <span>Instant Meshes</span> tool, which automaticall retopologised the mesh, decreasing the face count significantly.

                <h2>1.5 | Texturing Process</h2> <br>
                <p>I used <span>Substance Painter</span> for all of the texturing in this project. For some materials I may have used slightly different techniques, however the overall process was the same, so I will only display the process for the aforementioned filing cabinet, for brevity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I began by importing the low-poly mesh into Substance, and then, in the <span>bake mesh maps</span> panel, I baked the maps from the high-poly mesh onto the low.
                </p>
                <img src="assets/mars1984/cabinetbake.png" style="width: 1000px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
                <p><br>
                    Then, I imported one of the pre-made materials which come stock in subtance (in this case, both 'aluminium brushed worn' and 'plastic grainy soft'). <br><br>
                    I then changed the base fill colour for the plastic material to yellow, and added a <span>white mask</span>. This mask allows me to paint black anywhere on the mesh, and where I paint black, the underlying aluminium material shows instead.
                    <br>I used this to create a worn effect.
                    <br><br>
                    First I added a generator layer using the <span>metal edges</span> generator, and modified the values to create a realistic edge-wear, then I created a paint layer, and using different brush types (e.g. scratches), I made the paint wear much less uniform and more realistic.

                <p><br>
                    The handles were a separate material, I repeated a very similar process, however I used the 'base steel' smart material in place of the plastic material.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>NOTE</span>: There were some props/materials that required me to create my own material entirely from scratch, instead of using a smart material as a base.

                <h2>1.6 | Lighting & interactability</h2>
                <br>
                <p>For this project, I had the creative idea of having the only light sources in the scene be spotlights, coming from security cameras which track the players position. This adds a layer to the <span>interactability</span>
                of the scene, and allows for unique lighting.

                <br>
                <p>Further, I bought the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/p/examine-system-v1-169389">Examine System V1</a> asset by SpeedTutor in the <span>Unity Asset Store</span>. This asset allows for some props to be inspected and viewed from all angles, with a small description. <br>
                    <br>I felt like this was a great addition to the project, as it makes the scene feel immediately more alive, and it gives a sense of story to the environment.

            <p>To make the demo playable, I decided to use the pre-made character controller included with the examine system demo scene.
            <br><br>I used this despite the fact that I could create my own because I didn't want to spend time developing and refining a character controller, as the aim of this project is to develop and display my 3D environment art skills. Therefore, I made the easy decision to use a pre-existing character controller.

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>In my opinion, the biggest limitations to my scene are a lack of real-world details, (namely a lack of doors, etc). This could be improved by adding swinging doors that you can push, and perhaps some fake locked doors for environment detail.<br><br>
                    Adding some props to the scene did help with this, however to improve this further, I think that spending more time on broader details would help towards my goal. Spending time on researching real-world references and building a more realistic room would help improve this a lot.
                    <br><br>
                    I think the lighting in the scene is effective and unique, however a more intentiona and 'shaped' approach to lighting may improve the scene a lot.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, I would have liked to add an outdoor section, and perhaps particle effects such as dust to sell the 'abandoned' feel of the setting.

                <h2>Further Research</h2>
                <p>To further improve on this, or for similar projects in the future, I should research into advanced lighting techniques, architectural features, geometry nodes, and environment design principles. Specifically, studying professional lighting setups would help create more atmospheric and unique scenes, while deepening my knowledge of this mostly realistic artstyle would help develop this product more. Additionally, researching environment design principles would help create more intentional design choices that lead to a better compositional balance.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>This project has served as a great learning experience in environment design and 3D modeling. While working on it, I've improved my skills with industry-standard tools such as Blender, Unity and Substance Painter, I learned the importance of proper planning and reference gathering, and developed a better understanding of the entire pipeline from concept to playable environment. Though there are areas for improvement, particularly in lighting and realism, the project has successfully achieved its core goals of creating an interactive 3D scene. The challenges I faced have provided direction for my future learning and development as a 3D artist.</p>
